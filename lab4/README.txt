Thoughts:
For me whose programming ability is not very high, completing this task is not a small challenge. After all, it is the first time to use C language to solve biological problems. Moreover, file operation and data transmission are topics I haven't touched before. In order to complete Lab4, our group had an early discussion and began self-study and work. I'm ashamed that I didn't play a big role in the group work. The main part of the code was completed by two students. The biggest difficulty I encountered in completing this task is that there are many completely unfamiliar knowledge that I need to learn by myself. I have a preliminary understanding of relevant knowledge by querying CSDN, GitHub and other websites. Through my trial coding work, I have an understanding of file operation in C language environment and a clear understanding of C language development under Linux. I gained a lot from this work and learned a lot of knowledge.

This is the first time for me to finish a big assignment through teamwork. We quickly organized our group, and started our program on 3.26, when my teammate Zhu Xiangyu had already completed part of the code. Then I decided to work on the file access part. Since I hadn't learnt any knowledge about file access from my previous C courses, I read some related chapters of the programming book uploaded on canvas. Fortunately, I finished the code on 3.27. By that time we had almost finished the whole task. On 3.28 we wrote some annotating code, testing the whole library on Linux, revising some minor details. I am glad to find that our group is highly efficient and united. Through this project I realize the importance of self-learning and teamwork. I am so happy.

Our group started to discuss very early,  and raised our plan to solve it right on Thursday night.  We made fast progress and finished the main work in 3 days. Since the knowledge involved in the project was relatively basic and important, I tried to write all the modules independently. The final version submitted was that of the other two team members. 
The biggest difficulty of this project is that all the things used need to be self-taught. Wish the following projects can be more consistent with the teaching progress.
To sum up, after full self-study, our group is fully capable of completing this project, so this time we focus on making everyone understand all the knowledge, and the division of cooperation isn't too detailed and clear. On more difficult and complex projects, a collaborative division of work would be more necessary.

The assignment is normal but not easy. At first, I didn't understand what we should finish. Then, Our group discussed and got some ideas. 
At the same time, we also found some difficulties to finish them. The first thing is how to express the triplet codon table. If we use the way of three bases one group, the codes would be too long. But the reference website gave me inspiration. I could define four variables, and three expressed the bases one is amino acids.
The second is how to input. Our great members solve the question. They used a ingenious method to finish the input part of the code.
This assignment is the beginning of our group work and I hope we can do better in the future.
